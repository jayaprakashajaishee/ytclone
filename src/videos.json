Applies to US & Canada customers only and only applicable to select merchandise. See site for full terms). Thanks again to thredUP for sponsoring :)\n\nA Definitive Ranking of 2023 Pop Culture Moments\n\nmy new years resolution is to stop bringing up snap snap \n\nI can't believe it's already time for this video! This time last year we definitively ranked pop culture and meme moments from 2022 and I had a few of you ask for a 2023 version so here we are. Also thanks to everyone who has been sending stuff in over the past few weeks, really appreciate it :))  also x2 sorry if i sound quieter than usual i had the flu when i was recording this go easy on meeee thank u LOL and final also... (sorry) you prob noticed i had to try a different set up for filming this one, because this was a longer list and the tier size was going to change a lot i realized the easiest way to keep as much of it in view as possible was to ditch the green screen for this one so hope you dont mind!!!  \n\nOk SO after consulting you guys (and myself lol) i widdled down all the pop culture moments and memes that happened this year whether they were tik tok trends, twitter moments, celebrity pop culture stuff or other noteworthy events for us to rank today! We're talking the Josh Hutcherson whistle meme, Harry Styles going bald, Taylor Swift enjoying seemingly... ranch? The Pedro Pascal renaissance on Tiktok,  the \"girly teen girl\" twitter debate, Lana Del Rey working at waffle house and tons of other stuff too. \n\nLike I mentioned in the video this list isn't exhaustive, because my tier names are the way they are there are some things that just flat out do not make sense to rank within it lol so hope that's understandable! As always with these videos though while the ranking is definitive for me it doesn't have to be for you! Feel free to share your ranking in the comments i love seeing them :)) ALSO IF ANY OF YALL HAVE SEEN THOSE MONKEYS ON TIKTOK PLEEEEEEASE TELL ME I FEEL LIKE IM GOING CRAZY NONE OF MY IRLS HAVE SEEN THEM LMAO \n\nAnd ofc!!! hope you guys have a good holiday!! This time of the year can get super hectic and stressful so hope you're taking care of yourself. this past year on the internet has been so fun with yall and i seriously cant thank u enough for it i feel like a cornball when i try to explain it but i hope you know i feel really lucky and happy to have you guys, see you in the new year :) \n\nok i'll wrap it up lol if you liked the video feel free to give it like and subscribe to the channel it really helps me out :) you can also turn on my post notifications if you want to be notified every time I upload but otherwise, hope you guys enjoy and I'll see you in the comments!!\n\n//Other videos you might like\n\nExploring the World of ‚ÄúJobless‚Äù Celebrities\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Pk9ecXYHY\n\nExploring the Insane World of Colleen Hoover (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IatKojHB5KE \n\nExploring the World's Messiest Pop Star: Justin Bieber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpmaMz3ilbE\n\nExploring 2013 Pop Culture...

Thanks again to thredUP for sponsoring :)\n\nA Definitive Ranking of 2023 Pop Culture Moments\n\nmy new years resolution is to stop bringing up snap snap \n\nI can't believe it's already time for this video! This time last year we definitively ranked pop culture and meme moments from 2022 and I had a few of you ask for a 2023 version so here we are. Also thanks to everyone who has been sending stuff in over the past few weeks, really appreciate it :))  also x2 sorry if i sound quieter than usual i had the flu when i was recording this go easy on meeee thank u LOL and final also... (sorry) you prob noticed i had to try a different set up for filming this one, because this was a longer list and the tier size was going to change a lot i realized the easiest way to keep as much of it in view as possible was to ditch the green screen for this one so hope you dont mind!!!  \n\nOk SO after consulting you guys (and myself lol) i widdled down all the pop culture moments and memes that happened this year whether they were tik tok trends, twitter moments, celebrity pop culture stuff or other noteworthy events for us to rank today! We're talking the Josh Hutcherson whistle meme, Harry Styles going bald, Taylor Swift enjoying seemingly... ranch? The Pedro Pascal renaissance on Tiktok,  the \"girly teen girl\" twitter debate, Lana Del Rey working at waffle house and tons of other stuff too. \n\nLike I mentioned in the video this list isn't exhaustive, because my tier names are the way they are there are some things that just flat out do not make sense to rank within it lol so hope that's understandable! As always with these videos though while the ranking is definitive for me it doesn't have to be for you! Feel free to share your ranking in the comments i love seeing them :)) ALSO IF ANY OF YALL HAVE SEEN THOSE MONKEYS ON TIKTOK PLEEEEEEASE TELL ME I FEEL LIKE IM GOING CRAZY NONE OF MY IRLS HAVE SEEN THEM LMAO \n\nAnd ofc!!! hope you guys have a good holiday!! This time of the year can get super hectic and stressful so hope you're taking care of yourself. this past year on the internet has been so fun with yall and i seriously cant thank u enough for it i feel like a cornball when i try to explain it but i hope you know i feel really lucky and happy to have you guys, see you in the new year :) \n\nok i'll wrap it up lol if you liked the video feel free to give it like and subscribe to the channel it really helps me out :) you can also turn on my post notifications if you want to be notified every time I upload but otherwise, hope you guys enjoy and I'll see you in the comments!!\n\n//Other videos you might like\n\nExploring the World of ‚ÄúJobless‚Äù Celebrities\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Pk9ecXYHY\n\nExploring the Insane World of Colleen Hoover (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IatKojHB5KE \n\nExploring the World's Messiest Pop Star: Justin Bieber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpmaMz3ilbE\n\nExploring 2013 Pop Culture...

              "description": "In the opening round of the 2023 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods carded a combined 8-under 64.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PNC Championship is held for the 26th time this week as the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hosts 20 two-player teams featuring a PGA Tour, Champions tour or LPGA player and one of their family members. After Tiger Woods made his return to action at the Hero World Challenge for the first time since withdrawing at the Masters, he‚Äôll once again be back to tee it up at the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie. The duo was tied for second a year ago after the first round, but stalled on Sunday and ended up tied for eighth. Justin Thomas returns this year to play alongside his father, Mike.  Justin Thomas finished third at the Hero World Challenge two weeks ago and will be feeling confident about taking his second PNC Championship title, as the Thomases won here in 2020. Defending champions Vijay Singh and his son Qass are looking to recreate their magic from 2022. Last year was their 16th time teeing it up together at this event, and they finally broke through for a win, becoming the first pair to shoot two sub-60 rounds at the event. Other pairings to look out for are Nelly Korda and her father Petr, Matt Kuchar and his elder son Cameron, and Bernhard Langer and his son Jason.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

                  "description": "In the opening round of the 2023 PNC Championship, Tiger and Charlie Woods carded a combined 8-under 64.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PNC Championship is held for the 26th time this week as the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hosts 20 two-player teams featuring a PGA Tour, Champions tour or LPGA player and one of their family members. After Tiger Woods made his return to action at the Hero World Challenge for the first time since withdrawing at the Masters, he‚Äôll once again be back to tee it up at the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie. The duo was tied for second a year ago after the first round, but stalled on Sunday and ended up tied for eighth. Justin Thomas returns this year to play alongside his father, Mike.  Justin Thomas finished third at the Hero World Challenge two weeks ago and will be feeling confident about taking his second PNC Championship title, as the Thomases won here in 2020. Defending champions Vijay Singh and his son Qass are looking to recreate their magic from 2022. Last year was their 16th time teeing it up together at this event, and they finally broke through for a win, becoming the first pair to shoot two sub-60 rounds at the event. Other pairings to look out for are Nelly Korda and her father Petr, Matt Kuchar and his elder son Cameron, and Bernhard Langer and his son Jason.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/"
